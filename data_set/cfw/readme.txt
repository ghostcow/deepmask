different subsets of CFW (each in different mat file): 
(In all subsets the training-test proportions are 0.7-0.3)

Generated by SaveDataset.m : 
- cfw_small : first 200 persons
- cfw_1_574, cfw_575_1000, cfw_1001_1440 - full dataset (1,440 persons) seperated into
 	3 files beacuse of memory issues in MATLAB


Generated by CreateFlatDataset.m : 
- cfw_flat : full "flat" dataset. flat means all persons have 30-80 training samples.
	persons with less than 30 training samples were filtered out
	for persons with more than 80 training samples the 80 with best resolution were 	taken
- cfw_flat_1_574,cfw_flat_575_1000,cfw_flat_1001-1440 : cfw_flat cannot be loaded 
    into the memory because of the RAM limitation, so it's divided into 3 smaller files
    cfw_flat_1_574 - 240 persons (labels 1:240)
    cfw_flat_575_1000 - 181 persons (labels 1:181)
    cfw_flat_1001_1440 - 172 persons (labels 1:172)

NOTE : In the cfw_flat not all persons from the orginal cfw are used.
       However the nn layers in torch require contiguous labels so the persons labels were 
       trasnformed into continuos range where the mapping to the original labels were saved 
       into the variable originalLabels
